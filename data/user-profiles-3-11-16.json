Opportunity. Education. Social Impact.  Almost fifteen years ago, I became the first person in my family to graduate from a four-year college.  When I concluded my studies at Colgate University, I knew I was a different person than when I arrived. I also became increasingly aware that students like me, who came from low-income families, from families without two parents, from families without professional careers, were not common at places like Colgate.  Since then, I have worked across higher education and K12 in a variety of roles supporting students through college counseling, college admissions, community development, graduate school admissions, and now career services. My vision is to build relationships between educational institutions and community organizations with a social impact.

learning journey began my sophomore year in sociology where I uncovered the ugly truth I lived through plainly stated over and over again: Poverty entraps sick individuals in a cycle of illness, disease and poor health they cannot easily escape. In my studies, I took a three-pronged approach, studying health communications, community leadership and organizing, and medical sociology. By understanding health change models, community behavioral health, and medical history, I learned theory and combined with my clinical volunteering and bio-medical research, I gained insights into the true meaning of medicine, beyond the science, diagnoses and technicalities. \n\nI saw how patients and physicians worked together to create an accessible, well-designed and caring treatment plan. Quickly, I discovered this: for a patient to get better, a cohesive health care community must be created. Now I am working to harness this knowledge, leadership and entrepreneurial skills to create a model for better health care access & delivery.","Action Statement":"Innovative community builder building caring medical teams to provide greater access to high quality health care.","Action Statement | I am":0,"Action Statement | to":0,"Action Statement | in order to":0,"Impact Areas [Agriculture, Food, & Nutrition]":1,"Impact Areas [Arts & Culture Access]":0,"Impact Areas [Consumer Products & Supply Chain]":0,"Impact Areas [Corporate Philanthropy]":1,"Impact Areas [Disabilities]":0,"Impact Areas [Education]":1,"Impact Areas [Employment & Labor]":0,"Impact Areas [Environmental Sustainability]":0,"Impact Areas [Financial Access]":1,"Impact Areas [Gender Equality]":1,"Impact Areas [Government & Civic Engagement]":1,"Impact Areas [Housing]":0,"Impact Areas [Hunger]":0,"Impact Areas [Media]":0,"Impact Areas [Mental Health]":1,"Impact Areas [Peace & Security]":0,"Impact Areas [Public Health]":1,"Impact Areas [Social Justice]":1,"Impact Areas [Technology & Access]":0,"Impact Areas [Urban Development]":1,"Impact Areas [Violence & Abuse]":1,"Impact Areas [Youth Development]":1,"Impact Areas [Other, please specify...]":0,"Impact Areas [Other, please specify...] [text]":0,"Expertise [Accounting & Finance]":0,"Expertise [Budgeting]":0,"Expertise [Business Analytics]":0,"Expertise [Communication Strategy & PR]":1,"Expertise [Compliance]":0,"Expertise [Computer Programming]":0,"Expertise [Consulting]":0,"Expertise [Customer Service]":0,"Expertise [Database Engineering]":0,"Expertise [Digital and Online Marketing]":0,"Expertise [Event Production]":0,"Expertise [Graphic Design & Animation]":0,"Expertise [Information Architecture]":0,"Expertise [Law & Legal Services]":1,"Expertise [Mobile Development]":0,"Expertise [Negotiation]":0,"Expertise [Networking]":0,"Expertise [Performance Measurement]":0,"Expertise [Photography]":0,"Expertise [Project Management]":0,"Expertise [Project Planning]":1,"Expertise [Public Speaking]":1,"Expertise [Real Estate]":0,"Expertise [Recruiting & HR]":0,"Expertise [Sales]":0,"Expertise [Social Media]":0,"Expertise [Statistical Analysis & Data Mining]":0,"Expertise [Strategic Planning]":1,"Expertise [Teambuilding]":1,"Expertise [User Interface Design]":0,"Expertise [User Research & Ethnography]":0,"Expertise [Videography]":0,"Expertise [Web Development]":0,"Expertise [Writing]":1,"Expertise [Other, please specify...]":0,"Expertise [Other, please specify...] [text]":0,"Geographic Interest [Central America & Caribbean]":0,"Geographic Interest [Central Asia]":0,"Geographic Interest [East Africa]":0,"Geographic Interest [East Asia & Pacific]":0,"Geographic Interest [Europe]":0,"Geographic Interest [Global]":1,"Geographic Interest [Middle East & North Africa]":0,"Geographic Interest [North America]":1,"Geographic Interest [South America]":0,"Geographic Interest [South Asia]":0,"Geographic Interest [Sub-Saharan Africa]":0,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Global Social Impact House]":0,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Penn Social Impact House]":1,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Executive Program for Social Impact Strategy]":0,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Staff]":0,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Partner \/ Catalyst]":0,"What year did you participate in your first CSIS program?":2013,"Lat":39.9525839,"Lng":-75.1652215},{"Name | First":"SooHyen","Name | Middle":"Lucy","Name | Last":"Park","Name | Suffix":0,"Profile Picture":"http:\/\/socialimpactstrategy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/SooHyen-Park.jpg","City":"Portland","State (USA only)":"Oregon","Country":"United States","Title":"Founder","Current Organization \/ School":"SUNS","Email":"soohyenpark@gmail.com","Personal \/ Venture Website":"http:\/\/suns.life","Social Media Links | LinkedIn":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/soohyenpark","Social Media Links | Twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/soohyenpark","Social Media Links | Facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/soohyen.park","Social Media Links | Instagram":"https:\/\/instagram.com\/lawsforcreations\/","Short Bio":"SooHyen\ufffd\u06eas career in advertising began at Ogilvy & Mather, New York, where she worked on campaigns for global brands such as Motorola, Levi\ufffd\u06eas, Coca-Cola, and Miller Brewing Company.

urban and unequal. Every year, millions of people migrate to cities in search for a better life, some make it, while many struggle. In my home country, Macedonia, most young talented minds want to emigrate abroad. Taking these trends into account, I believe that one of the most important challenges of the 21st century is promoting sustainable and equitable urban and regional economic development. I pursued my Master\ufffd\u06eas Degree in City Planning at the University of Pennsylvania with the aim of learning how I can contribute in shaping urban and regional policy to make a positive impact. My career goal is to contribute in the economic development of cities and regions, especially those in emerging market economies, such as in Eastern Europe and Latin America.
