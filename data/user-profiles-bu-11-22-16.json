Opportunity. Education. Social Impact.  Almost fifteen years ago, I became the first person in my family to graduate from a four-year college.  When I concluded my studies at Colgate University, I knew I was a different person than when I arrived. I also became increasingly aware that students like me, who came from low-income families, from families without two parents, from families without professional careers, were not common at places like Colgate.  Since then, I have worked across higher education and K12 in a variety of roles supporting students through college counseling, college admissions, community development, graduate school admissions, and now career services. My vision is to build relationships between educational institutions and community organizations with a social impact.  I work to empower young people toward educational and career equity of opportunity through mentoring, counseling and engagement with a focus on social impact and social entrepreneurship, education and nonprofits, government and public service, and consulting.","Action Statement":0,"Action Statement | I am":"hacking career services","Action Statement | to":"build first generation student's skills, networks and experiences","Action Statement | in order to":"increase educational opportunity and career outcomes","Impact Areas [Agriculture, Food, & Nutrition]":"","Impact Areas [Arts & Culture Access]":"","Impact Areas [Consumer Products & Supply Chain]":"","Impact Areas [Corporate Philanthropy]":"","Impact Areas [Disabilities]":"","Impact Areas [Education]":1,"Impact Areas [Employment & Labor]":1,"Impact Areas [Environmental Sustainability]":"","Impact Areas [Financial Access]":"","Impact Areas [Gender Equality]":"","Impact Areas [Government & Civic Engagement]":"","Impact Areas [Housing]":"","Impact Areas [Hunger]":"","Impact Areas [Media]":"","Impact Areas [Mental Health]":"","Impact Areas [Peace & Security]":"","Impact Areas [Public Health]":"","Impact Areas [Social Justice]":1,"Impact Areas [Technology & Access]":"","Impact Areas [Urban Development]":"","Impact Areas [Violence & Abuse]":"","Impact Areas [Youth Development]":1,"Impact Areas [Other, please specify...]":"","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Expertise [Accounting & Finance]":"","Expertise [Budgeting]":"","Expertise [Business Analytics]":"","Expertise [Communication Strategy & PR]":"","Expertise [Compliance]":"","Expertise [Computer Programming]":"","Expertise [Consulting]":"","Expertise [Customer Service]":"","Expertise [Database Engineering]":"","Expertise [Digital and Online Marketing]":"","Expertise [Event Production]":"","Expertise [Graphic Design & Animation]":"","Expertise [Information Architecture]":"","Expertise [Law & Legal Services]":"","Expertise [Mobile Development]":"","Expertise [Negotiation]":"","Expertise [Networking]":1,"Expertise [Performance Measurement]":"","Expertise [Photography]":"","Expertise [Project Management]":"","Expertise [Project Planning]":1,"Expertise [Public Speaking]":1,"Expertise [Real Estate]":"","Expertise [Recruiting & HR]":1,"Expertise [Sales]":"","Expertise [Social Media]":1,"Expertise [Statistical Analysis & Data Mining]":"","Expertise [Strategic Planning]":1,"Expertise [Teambuilding]":1,"Expertise [User Interface Design]":"","Expertise [User Research & Ethnography]":"","Expertise [Videography]":"","Expertise [Web Development]":"","Expertise [Writing]":"","Expertise [Other, please specify...]":1,"Expertise [Other, please specify...] [text]":"personal branding","Geographic Interest [Central America & Caribbean]":"","Geographic Interest [Central Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [East Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [East Asia & Pacific]":"","Geographic Interest [Europe]":"","Geographic Interest [Global]":"","Geographic Interest [Middle East & North Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [North America]":1,"Geographic Interest [South America]":"","Geographic Interest [South Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [Sub-Saharan Africa]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Global Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Penn Social Impact House]":1,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Executive Program for Social Impact Strategy]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Staff]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Partner \/ Catalyst]":"","What year did you participate in your first CSIS program?":2015,"Lat":32.7766642,"Lng":-96.7969879},{"Name | First":"Dhruv","Name | Middle":"","Name | Last":"Maheshwari","Name | Suffix":"","Profile Picture":"http:\/\/socialimpactstrategy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Dhruv-Maheshwari.jpg","City":"Mountain View","State (USA only)":"California","Country":"United States","Title":"Associate Product Manager","Current Organization \/ School":"LinkedIn","Email":"dhwari@gmail.com","Personal \/ Venture Website":"http:\/\/hack4impact.org","Social Media Links | LinkedIn":"","Social Media Links | Twitter":"@dhruvlife","Social Media Links | Facebook":"","Social Media Links | Instagram":"","Short Bio":"Dhruv Maheshwari is a graduating senior in the Management and Technology Program at the University of Pennsylvania, studying computer science and business, with a certificate in Civic Scholarship.

had to directly make a difference in the lives of the less fortunate. After a semester of Social Work school, I felt there was something missing; I was in the wrong helping profession. Falling into the corporate world at Zenith Media, I was placed on the nonprofit pro-bono account Autism Speaks. I learned this account was part of Zenith's Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. This experience opened my eyes to a career path that would ultimately merge my two worlds: my desire to make a difference for those in need and my appreciation for the corporate sector. Currently, I work as a Client Success Manager at Causecast, a modern software technology platform that makes it easy to engage employees in a company's volunteering and giving efforts. Through its Community Impact Platform, Causecast automates and enhances systems for employee volunteering, giving, matching, rewarding and disaster relief. Causecast's vision is to foster a cutting-edge social ecosystem that elevates corporate social responsibility to a whole new level, where sustainable and measurable accomplishments move the needle on an organization's social mission, employee culture and bottom line.","Action Statement":0,"Action Statement | I am":"passionate","Action Statement | to":"use the power of business","Action Statement | in order to":"help make the world a better place","Impact Areas [Agriculture, Food, & Nutrition]":"","Impact Areas [Arts & Culture Access]":"","Impact Areas [Consumer Products & Supply Chain]":"","Impact Areas [Corporate Philanthropy]":1,"Impact Areas [Disabilities]":"","Impact Areas [Education]":"","Impact Areas [Employment & Labor]":"","Impact Areas [Environmental Sustainability]":"","Impact Areas [Financial Access]":"","Impact Areas [Gender Equality]":"","Impact Areas [Government & Civic Engagement]":"","Impact Areas [Housing]":"","Impact Areas [Hunger]":"","Impact Areas [Media]":1,"Impact Areas [Mental Health]":"","Impact Areas [Peace & Security]":"","Impact Areas [Public Health]":"","Impact Areas [Social Justice]":"","Impact Areas [Technology & Access]":"","Impact Areas [Urban Development]":"","Impact Areas [Violence & Abuse]":"","Impact Areas [Youth Development]":"","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...]":1,"Impact Areas [Other, please specify...] [text]":"Employee Engagement","Expertise [Accounting & Finance]":"","Expertise [Budgeting]":"","Expertise [Business Analytics]":"","Expertise [Communication Strategy & PR]":"","Expertise [Compliance]":"","Expertise [Computer Programming]":"","Expertise [Consulting]":"","Expertise [Customer Service]":1,"Expertise [Database Engineering]":"","Expertise [Digital and Online Marketing]":"","Expertise [Event Production]":"","Expertise [Graphic Design & Animation]":"","Expertise [Information Architecture]":"","Expertise [Law & Legal Services]":"","Expertise [Mobile Development]":"","Expertise [Negotiation]":"","Expertise [Networking]":"","Expertise [Performance Measurement]":"","Expertise [Photography]":"","Expertise [Project Management]":"","Expertise [Project Planning]":"","Expertise [Public Speaking]":"","Expertise [Real Estate]":"","Expertise [Recruiting & HR]":"","Expertise [Sales]":"","Expertise [Social Media]":"","Expertise [Statistical Analysis & Data Mining]":"","Expertise [Strategic Planning]":1,"Expertise [Teambuilding]":"","Expertise [User Interface Design]":"","Expertise [User Research & Ethnography]":"","Expertise [Videography]":"","Expertise [Web Development]":"","Expertise [Writing]":"","Expertise [Other, please specify...]":1,"Expertise [Other, please specify...] [text]":"Employee Engagement","Geographic Interest [Central America & Caribbean]":"","Geographic Interest [Central Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [East Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [East Asia & Pacific]":"","Geographic Interest [Europe]":"","Geographic Interest [Global]":1,"Geographic Interest [Middle East & North Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [North America]":1,"Geographic Interest [South America]":"","Geographic Interest [South Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [Sub-Saharan Africa]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Global Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Penn Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Executive Program for Social Impact Strategy]":1,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Staff]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Partner \/ Catalyst]":"","What year did you participate in your first CSIS program?":2015,"Lat":40.7127837,"Lng":-74.0059413},{"Name | First":"Patricia","Name | Middle":"","Name | Last":"Feria Lim","Name | Suffix":"","Profile Picture":"http:\/\/socialimpactstrategy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Patricia-Feria-Lim.jpg","City":"Makati","State (USA only)":"Philippines","Country":"Philippines","Title":"Chief Strategic Resources Officer","Current Organization \/ School":"Teach for the Philippines","Email":"pkferia@gmail.com","Personal \/ Venture Website":"http:\/\/Teachforthephilippines.org","Social Media Links | LinkedIn":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/view?id=22531106&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=41gQ&locale=en_US&srchid=225311061424680226774&srchindex=1&srchtotal=28&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A225311061424680226774%2CVSRPtargetId%3A22531106%2CVSRP","Social Media Links | Twitter":"","Social Media Links | Facebook":"","Social Media Links | Instagram":"","Short Bio":"Patricia began her career in Finance, in New York,  where she spent four years in Global Corporate Banking at Citi.

He is a Professor of Social Policy, and Faculty Director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy, both at the University of Pennsylvania. A Mindy and Andrew Heyer Chair in Social Policy, his research and teaching focus on philanthropy, nonprofit management, and social entrepreneurship.\n\nFrumkin has written articles on all aspects of philanthropy, including the formulation of grantmaking strategy, the changing profile of major individual donors, theories of philanthropic leverage, the professionalization movement within foundations, and other topics. His book, Strategic Giving: The Art and Science of Philanthropy, was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2006. It has been touted by reviewers as the benchmark text for the field and the most penetrating exploration of contemporary philanthropy now available. He has lectured on philanthropy at meetings of grantmakers in the U.S. and abroad, and served as a consultant to foundations and individual donors on strategy and evaluation.\n\nFrumkin is the author of Building for the Arts (co-authored with Ana Kolendo; University of Chicago Press, 2014), which considers the management challenges associated with the recent cultural building boom in America. Frumkin, On Being Nonprofit (Harvard University Press, 2002), won the best book award from the Academy of Management's public and nonprofit section. This book considers the changing roles and responsibilities of nonprofit organizations in American democracy and the evolution of public policies shaping the sector growth. He has also authored numerous articles on topics related to nonprofit management, including ones focusing on compensation policies in nonprofit organizations, the effective deployment of volunteers, the impact of fundraising strategies on nonprofit revenue generation, nonprofit accountability systems, and the effects of public funding on nonprofit mission definition.\n\nIn 2010, two books by Frumkin were published: Serving Country and Community co-authored with JoAnn Jastrzab (Harvard, 2010), which examines the effectiveness of the national service programs AmeriCorps and VISTA, and The Essence of Strategic Giving: A Practical Guide for Donors and Fundraisers (University of Chicago Press, 2010), which provides a roadmap for how to improve the effectiveness of philanthropy. The Strategic Management of Charter Schools (Harvard 2011), which Frumkin co-authored with Bruno Manno and Nell Edgington, develops a systematic way of thinking about and handling the many management challenges associated with starting and sustaining a charter school.\n\nPrior to coming to Penn, Frumkin was Professor of Public Affairs and Director of the RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin. He has taught at Harvard University's John F.

Bio":"My learning journey began my sophomore year in sociology where I uncovered the ugly truth I lived through plainly stated over and over again: Poverty entraps sick individuals in a cycle of illness, disease and poor health they cannot easily escape. In my studies, I took a three-pronged approach, studying health communications, community leadership and organizing, and medical sociology. By understanding health change models, community behavioral health, and medical history, I learned theory and combined with my clinical volunteering and bio-medical research, I gained insights into the true meaning of medicine, beyond the science, diagnoses and technicalities. \n\nI saw how patients and physicians worked together to create an accessible, well-designed and caring treatment plan. Quickly, I discovered this: for a patient to get better, a cohesive health care community must be created. Now I am working to harness this knowledge, leadership and entrepreneurial skills to create a model for better health care access & delivery.","Action Statement":"Innovative community builder building caring medical teams to provide greater access to high quality health care.","Action Statement | I am":"","Action Statement | to":"","Action Statement | in order to":"","Impact Areas [Agriculture, Food, & Nutrition]":1,"Impact Areas [Arts & Culture Access]":"","Impact Areas [Consumer Products & Supply Chain]":"","Impact Areas [Corporate Philanthropy]":1,"Impact Areas [Disabilities]":"","Impact Areas [Education]":1,"Impact Areas [Employment & Labor]":"","Impact Areas [Environmental Sustainability]":"","Impact Areas [Financial Access]":1,"Impact Areas [Gender Equality]":1,"Impact Areas [Government & Civic Engagement]":1,"Impact Areas [Housing]":"","Impact Areas [Hunger]":"","Impact Areas [Media]":"","Impact Areas [Mental Health]":1,"Impact Areas [Peace & Security]":"","Impact Areas [Public Health]":1,"Impact Areas [Social Justice]":1,"Impact Areas [Technology & Access]":"","Impact Areas [Urban Development]":1,"Impact Areas [Violence & Abuse]":1,"Impact Areas [Youth Development]":1,"Impact Areas [Other, please specify...]":"","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Expertise [Accounting & Finance]":"","Expertise [Budgeting]":"","Expertise [Business Analytics]":"","Expertise [Communication Strategy & PR]":1,"Expertise [Compliance]":"","Expertise [Computer Programming]":"","Expertise [Consulting]":"","Expertise [Customer Service]":"","Expertise [Database Engineering]":"","Expertise [Digital and Online Marketing]":"","Expertise [Event Production]":"","Expertise [Graphic Design & Animation]":"","Expertise [Information Architecture]":"","Expertise [Law & Legal Services]":1,"Expertise [Mobile Development]":"","Expertise [Negotiation]":"","Expertise [Networking]":"","Expertise [Performance Measurement]":"","Expertise [Photography]":"","Expertise [Project Management]":"","Expertise [Project Planning]":1,"Expertise [Public Speaking]":1,"Expertise [Real Estate]":"","Expertise [Recruiting & HR]":"","Expertise [Sales]":"","Expertise [Social Media]":"","Expertise [Statistical Analysis & Data Mining]":"","Expertise [Strategic Planning]":1,"Expertise [Teambuilding]":1,"Expertise [User Interface Design]":"","Expertise [User Research & Ethnography]":"","Expertise [Videography]":"","Expertise [Web Development]":"","Expertise [Writing]":1,"Expertise [Other, please specify...]":"","Expertise [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Geographic Interest [Central America & Caribbean]":"","Geographic Interest [Central Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [East Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [East Asia & Pacific]":"","Geographic Interest [Europe]":"","Geographic Interest [Global]":1,"Geographic Interest [Middle East & North Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [North America]":1,"Geographic Interest [South America]":"","Geographic Interest [South Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [Sub-Saharan Africa]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Global Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Penn Social Impact House]":1,"Primary Affiliation with the Center [Executive Program for Social Impact Strategy]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Staff]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Partner \/ Catalyst]":"","What year did you participate in your first CSIS program?":2013,"Lat":39.9525839,"Lng":-75.1652215},{"Name | First":"Sona","Name | Middle":"","Name | Last":"Shah","Name | Suffix":"","Profile Picture":"http:\/\/socialimpactstrategy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/sona.png","City":"New York City","State (USA only)":"New York","Country":"United States","Title":"Co-Founder & CEO","Current Organization \/ School":"Neopenda","Email":"sona@neopenda.com","Personal \/ Venture Website":"www.neopenda.com","Social Media Links | LinkedIn":"","Social Media Links | Twitter":"","Social Media Links | Facebook":"","Social Media Links | Instagram":"","Short Bio":"Sona is CEO and co-founder of Neopenda, a global health startup passionate about reducing newborn mortality in the developing world.
