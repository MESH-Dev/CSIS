He is a Professor of Social Policy, and Faculty Director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy, both at the University of Pennsylvania. A Mindy and Andrew Heyer Chair in Social Policy, his research and teaching focus on philanthropy, nonprofit management, and social entrepreneurship.\n\nFrumkin has written articles on all aspects of philanthropy, including the formulation of grantmaking strategy, the changing profile of major individual donors, theories of philanthropic leverage, the professionalization movement within foundations, and other topics. His book, Strategic Giving: The Art and Science of Philanthropy, was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2006. It has been touted by reviewers as the 'benchmark text for the field' and 'the most penetrating exploration of contemporary philanthropy now available.' He has lectured on philanthropy at meetings of grantmakers in the U.S. and abroad, and served as a consultant to foundations and individual donors on strategy and evaluation.\n\nFrumkin is the author of Building for the Arts (co-authored with Ana Kolendo; University of Chicago Press, 2014), which considers the management challenges associated with the recent cultural building boom in America. Frumkin's On Being Nonprofit (Harvard University Press, 2002) won the best book award from the Academy of Management's public and nonprofit section. This book considers the changing roles and responsibilities of nonprofit organizations in American democracy and the evolution of public policies shaping the sector's growth. He has also authored numerous articles on topics related to nonprofit management, including ones focusing on compensation policies in nonprofit organizations, the effective deployment of volunteers, the impact of fundraising strategies on nonprofit revenue generation, nonprofit accountability systems, and the effects of public funding on nonprofit mission definition.\n\nIn 2010, two books by Frumkin were published: Serving Country and Community co-authored with JoAnn Jastrzab (Harvard, 2010), which examines the effectiveness of the national service programs AmeriCorps and VISTA, and The Essence of Strategic Giving: A Practical Guide for Donors and Fundraisers (University of Chicago Press, 2010), which provides a roadmap for how to improve the effectiveness of philanthropy. The Strategic Management of Charter Schools (Harvard 2011), which Frumkin co-authored with Bruno Manno and Nell Edgington, develops a systematic way of thinking about and handling the many management challenges associated with starting and sustaining a charter school.\n\nPrior to coming to Penn, Frumkin was Professor of Public Affairs and Director of the RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin. He has taught at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and served as a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Before academics, Frumkin worked as a foundation program officer, a nonprofit manager, and as a program evaluator in both nonprofit and public agencies. Frumkin received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago.","Action Statement":"","Action Statement | I am":"","Action Statement | to":"","Action Statement | in order to":"","Ask me about:":"","I am looking for:":"","If you have a link to a pitch video, please copy it here:":"","Impact Areas [Agriculture, Food, & Nutrition]":"","Impact Areas [Arts & Culture Access]":"1","Impact Areas [Consumer Products & Supply Chain]":"","Impact Areas [Corporate Philanthropy]":"1","Impact Areas [Disabilities]":"","Impact Areas [Education]":"1","Impact Areas [Employment & Labor]":"","Impact Areas [Environmental Sustainability]":"","Impact Areas [Financial Access]":"","Impact Areas [Gender Equality]":"","Impact Areas [Government & Civic Engagement]":"","Impact Areas [Housing]":"","Impact Areas [Hunger]":"","Impact Areas [Media]":"","Impact Areas [Mental Health]":"","Impact Areas [Peace & Security]":"","Impact Areas [Public Health]":"","Impact Areas [Social Justice]":"","Impact Areas [Technology & Access]":"","Impact Areas [Urban Development]":"","Impact Areas [Violence & Abuse]":"","Impact Areas [Youth Development]":"1","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...]":"","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Expertise [Accounting & Finance]":"1","Expertise [Budgeting]":"1","Expertise [Business Analytics]":"","Expertise [Communication Strategy & PR]":"1","Expertise [Compliance]":"","Expertise [Computer Programming]":"","Expertise [Consulting]":"","Expertise [Customer Service]":"","Expertise [Database Engineering]":"","Expertise [Digital and Online Marketing]":"","Expertise [Event Production]":"","Expertise [Graphic Design & Animation]":"","Expertise [Information Architecture]":"","Expertise [Law & Legal Services]":"","Expertise [Mobile Development]":"","Expertise [Negotiation]":"1","Expertise [Networking]":"1","Expertise [Performance Measurement]":"1","Expertise [Photography]":"","Expertise [Project Management]":"","Expertise [Project Planning]":"1","Expertise [Public Speaking]":"1","Expertise [Real Estate]":"","Expertise [Recruiting & HR]":"","Expertise [Sales]":"","Expertise [Social Media]":"","Expertise [Statistical Analysis & Data Mining]":"","Expertise [Strategic Planning]":"1","Expertise [Teambuilding]":"","Expertise [User Interface Design]":"","Expertise [User Research & Ethnography]":"1","Expertise [Videography]":"","Expertise [Web Development]":"","Expertise [Writing]":"1","Expertise [Other, please specify...]":"","Expertise [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Geographic Interest [Central America & Caribbean]":"","Geographic Interest [Central Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [East Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [East Asia & Pacific]":"","Geographic Interest [Europe]":"","Geographic Interest [Global]":"1","Geographic Interest [Middle East & North Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [North America]":"","Geographic Interest [South America]":"","Geographic Interest [South Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [Sub-Saharan Africa]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Global Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Penn Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Executive Program for Social Impact Strategy]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Staff]":"1","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Partner \/ Catalyst]":"","What year did you participate in your first CSIS program?":"N\/A (Staff)","Would you like your profile data to be visible on the Center's Global Network page?":"Yes","Applicant's first name":"","Applicant's last name":"","Applicant's full name":"","Applicant's email":"","Applicant ID":null},{"Owner":"Cosmo Fujiyama","Name | First":"Cosmo","Name | Middle":"","Name | Last":"Fujiyama","Name | Suffix":"","Name":"","Profile Picture":"http:\/\/csis.bkfk-t5yk.accessdomain.com\/CSIS\/wp-content\/themes\/csis\/data\/img\/Cosmo-Fujiyama.jpg","City":"Brooklyn","State (USA only)":"NY","Country":"United States","Title":"Director of Programs","Current Organization \/ School":"Center for Social Impact Strategy","Email":"cosmo@socialimpactstrategy.org","Personal \/ Venture Website":"","Social Media Links | LinkedIn":"","Social Media Links | Facebook":"","Social Media Links | Twitter":"","Social Media Links | Instagram":"","Social Media Links":"","Short Bio":"Cosmo Fujiyama is a nonprofit strategist, program designer and facilitator passionate about citizen engagement, education, and social\ninnovation.

In my studies, I took a three-pronged approach, studying health communications, community leadership and organizing, and medical sociology. By understanding health change models, community behavioral health, and medical history, I learned theory and combined with my clinical volunteering and bio-medical research, I gained insights into the true meaning of medicine, beyond the science, diagnoses and technicalities. \n\nI saw how patients and physicians worked together to create an accessible, well-designed and caring treatment plan. Quickly, I discovered this: for a patient to get better, a cohesive health care community must be created. Now I am working to harness this knowledge, leadership and entrepreneurial skills to create a model for better health care access & delivery.

At Nuestra Escuela, I met students who were involved in gangs and dealt drugs. I met one teenager whose brother was killed in front of his eyes. Today, this teenager, and others like him, have been able to graduate from high school and get jobs in the formal sector. This is all thanks to the fact that at Nuestra Escuela, each student defines his or her own goals and learning objectives. The teachers are there to help them achieve their goals. \n\n\n\nThis is why I believe in democratic schools.

I currently serve as CCO of the fund and hope to find through this experience a sustainable model that could be applied to aid poverty in Ecuador.","Action Statement":"","Action Statement | I am":"","Action Statement | to":"","Action Statement | in order to":"","Ask me about:":"","I am looking for:":"","If you have a link to a pitch video, please copy it here:":"","Impact Areas [Agriculture, Food, & Nutrition]":"","Impact Areas [Arts & Culture Access]":"","Impact Areas [Consumer Products & Supply Chain]":"","Impact Areas [Corporate Philanthropy]":"1","Impact Areas [Disabilities]":"","Impact Areas [Education]":"1","Impact Areas [Employment & Labor]":"","Impact Areas [Environmental Sustainability]":"","Impact Areas [Financial Access]":"1","Impact Areas [Gender Equality]":"","Impact Areas [Government & Civic Engagement]":"1","Impact Areas [Housing]":"","Impact Areas [Hunger]":"","Impact Areas [Media]":"","Impact Areas [Mental Health]":"","Impact Areas [Peace & Security]":"","Impact Areas [Public Health]":"1","Impact Areas [Social Justice]":"","Impact Areas [Technology & Access]":"","Impact Areas [Urban Development]":"1","Impact Areas [Violence & Abuse]":"","Impact Areas [Youth Development]":"","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...]":"","Impact Areas [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Expertise [Accounting & Finance]":"","Expertise [Budgeting]":"","Expertise [Business Analytics]":"","Expertise [Communication Strategy & PR]":"","Expertise [Compliance]":"","Expertise [Computer Programming]":"","Expertise [Consulting]":"","Expertise [Customer Service]":"","Expertise [Database Engineering]":"","Expertise [Digital and Online Marketing]":"","Expertise [Event Production]":"","Expertise [Graphic Design & Animation]":"","Expertise [Information Architecture]":"","Expertise [Law & Legal Services]":"","Expertise [Mobile Development]":"","Expertise [Negotiation]":"","Expertise [Networking]":"","Expertise [Performance Measurement]":"","Expertise [Photography]":"","Expertise [Project Management]":"","Expertise [Project Planning]":"","Expertise [Public Speaking]":"","Expertise [Real Estate]":"","Expertise [Recruiting & HR]":"","Expertise [Sales]":"","Expertise [Social Media]":"","Expertise [Statistical Analysis & Data Mining]":"","Expertise [Strategic Planning]":"","Expertise [Teambuilding]":"","Expertise [User Interface Design]":"","Expertise [User Research & Ethnography]":"","Expertise [Videography]":"","Expertise [Web Development]":"","Expertise [Writing]":"","Expertise [Other, please specify...]":"","Expertise [Other, please specify...] [text]":"","Geographic Interest [Central America & Caribbean]":"1","Geographic Interest [Central Asia]":"","Geographic Interest [East Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [East Asia & Pacific]":"","Geographic Interest [Europe]":"","Geographic Interest [Global]":"1","Geographic Interest [Middle East & North Africa]":"","Geographic Interest [North America]":"","Geographic Interest [South America]":"1","Geographic Interest [South Asia]":"1","Geographic Interest [Sub-Saharan Africa]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Global Social Impact House]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Penn Social Impact House]":"1","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Executive Program for Social Impact Strategy]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Staff]":"","Primary Affiliation with the Center [Partner \/ Catalyst]":"","What year did you participate in your first CSIS program?":"2014","Would you like your profile data to be visible on the Center's Global Network page?":"Yes","Applicant's first name":"","Applicant's last name":"","Applicant's full name":"","Applicant's email":"","Applicant ID":null},{"Owner":"Andrea Schiller","Name | First":"Andrea","Name | Middle":"","Name | Last":"Schiller","Name | Suffix":"","Name":"","Profile Picture":"http:\/\/csis.bkfk-t5yk.accessdomain.com\/CSIS\/wp-content\/themes\/csis\/data\/img\/Andrea-Schiller.jpg","City":"Washington ","State (USA only)":"DC","Country":"United States","Title":"Product Marketing Specialist ","Current Organization \/ School":"MicroStrategy","Email":"agschiller@gmail.com","Personal \/ Venture Website":"","Social Media Links | LinkedIn":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/agschiller","Social Media Links | Facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/andrea.schiller.52","Social Media Links | Twitter":"@agschiller","Social Media Links | Instagram":"https:\/\/instagram.com\/agschil\/","Social Media Links":"","Short Bio":"Andrea Schiller is a Product Marketing Specialist on the Mobile Products team at MicroStrategy, an enterprise software company.

felt blessed in opportunities given and want to spend my life being part of creating opportunities for others less fortunate; passing on the blessing. I have a passion for Africa and its people since the age of 10 (triggered by an inspiring Cameroon missionary). While completing 3 masters at Management and Social Departments, I first set foot on African soil in Tanzania researching for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Next stop was Zambia working for the World Food Program (WFP) and later a USAID backed private commodity exchange. In Rwanda I helped set-up a local purchasing program for WFP and the Rwandan Government. In Ethiopia I led a Bill and Melinda Gates program linking smallholders to the international market. Today I live in the small town of Yei in conflict-torn South Sudan dreaming to set-up a coffee industry here. Nepresso and George Clooney are backing it.
